# SERUM-METABOLITES-IN-PREDICTING-CT-FINDINGS-FOLLOWING-TBI
We build a ML model that can be deployed to point-of-care test kits for determining the need for CT scan in cases of mild traumatic brain injury. 
Efficiently triaging traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients arriving at the Emergency Room (ER) greatly improves their management. The idea of having a point of care test kit that can predict TBI patients that are likely to have a positive or negative CT finding will shorten Arrival to Decision time (ADT), minimize unnecessary exposure to the ionizing radiation of a CT scan, and reduce the cost of management especially in regions where CT scans aren’t readily available.  On this note, a study done by Dickens et al measured serum metabolites that extravasates the blood brain barrier following TBI as a predictor of the severity of CT findings using the Marshall Grade [grade 1 (CT negative), grade 2–6 (CT positive)]. 
Marshall grade 2–4 is further categorized as (diffuse injury) while grade 5–6 (mass lesion).  Obviously, depending on the extent of injury a TBI patient will require a CT scan. However, the Glasgow Comma Scale (GCS) which is used to clinically classify the severity is quite subjective and not so accurate. Hence, TBI patients that may have a positive CT finding may be under classified as mild.
2.0 OBJECTIVE
This study aims use Machine Learning (ML) classification models to determine whether: 
1)The measured extravasated serum metabolites can effectively be used to differentiate specifically mild TBI patients with positive CT findings from those with negative findings.
2)Differentiate those with diffuse injury from those with mass lesion. 
3)Compare model performance with that of previous study.
